# Codeup Vagrant Box & Ansible Scripts

This repository contains files and scripts intended for [Codeup](http://www.codeup.com) students to use throughout their class. It contains:

1. A Vagrantfile definition for local development and testing of LAMP based applications
1. Ansible scripts for deploying those same applications to a production server, in particular those hosted by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)

## Installation & Setup

Ideally this repository should be downloaded and configured using the LAMP Setup Script hosted [here](https://github.com/bbatsche/LAMP-Setup-Script). In addition to installing the necessary tools and utilities, it will also create a new SSH key the Ansible scripts will setup for use with the DigitalOcean droplet.

## Creating a Site in Vagrant

When you first run `vagrant up` inside this directory, Vagrant will automatically run the necessary Ansible scripts to configure your test server and setup your first site. Later on in the course if you need to create additional sites you can do so by running:

```
ansible-playbook ansible/site-create.yml -l vagrant -e "domain=<your new domain>"
```

The `site-create.yml` script can also optionally add your new domain to your local hosts file, facilitating the local deployment process. In order to do so however, you must have administer rights and run the script in the following manner:

```
sudo ansible-playbook ansible/site-create.yml -l vagrant -e "domain=<your new domain>" -e "append_host=true"
```

## Setting up a Digital Ocean Server

We use DigitalOcean in part because their signup process is quite straight forward and easy to follow. Simply navigate to the [signup page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new) and follow the prompts.

In order to manage the users on your new server, we need to install a Python library for Ansible to use. On your Mac, run the following command:

```
sudo easy_install passlib
```

### Adding a Key

If you used the LAMP Setup Script provided you should have an SSH key generated for you. You must add that key to your DigitalOcean account in order to connect to your server. In order to do so, follow these steps

1. Navigate to the [SSH Keys section](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/ssh_keys) in your DigitalOcean account page.
1. Click "Add SSH Key"
1. Copy the contents of the file `~/.ssh/codeup_rsa.pub` (hint, you can do this easily by running `cat ~/.ssh/codeup_rsa.pub | pbcopy`)
1. Give your key a meaningful name (something like "Codeup SSH Key") and then paste your key data into the form.
1. Now save your changes.

### Creating a Droplet

1. Click the [Create](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new) button
1. Give your server a meaningful hostname
1. Pretty much all of the default options selected are appropriate for your first droplet (512MB / New York 2 / Ubuntu 14.04)
1. **Make sure you select the option to add your SSH key to your new droplet!**
1. Click create and then wait.
1. Make sure to note your droplet's new IP address

### Editing Local Configs

1. Edit your local SSH config file by running `subl ~/.ssh/config`. You should see something similar to the following already there:
```
Host github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/codeup_rsa
```
1. Make sure to copy your droplet's IP address and add the following two lines to the file
```
Host <droplet IP address>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/codeup_rsa
```
1. Edit `ansible/hosts` and remove the `;` from the start of the line containing `digital_ocean`
1. Replace the `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` with your droplet's IP address

### Provisioning the Server

Run the following command to initialize your server

```
ansible-playbook ansible/do-init.yml
```

## Adding a Site to Digital Ocean

Adding a site to your DigitalOcean droplet is similar to adding one to your Vagrant box, although we need to tell Ansible to ask for your password first:

```
ansible-playbook ansible/site-create.yml -l digital_ocean -e "domain=<your new domain>"  --ask-sudo-pass
```

### Next Steps

1. As the Ansible script runs, two messages with git commands should be outputted. Run those commands from within your application's root directory.
1. You must now SSH into your server and run the standard composer and artisan commands to initialize your application.

## Managing MySQL

Included with these files is also a script to aide in setting up MySQL users & databases. In order to create a MySQL administrator, use the following command

```
ansible-playbook ansible/mysql-user-db.yml -l <vagrant|digital_ocean> -e "mysql_admin=true"
```

To make a new database & user for your application use the following:

```
ansible-playbook ansible/mysql-user-db.yml -l <vagrant|digital_ocean> -e "db_name=<databse name>"
```
